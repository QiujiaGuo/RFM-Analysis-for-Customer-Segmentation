# RFM Customer Segmentation with K-Means

This project uses the K-means clustering algorithm to perform RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis: when customers' last purchase was, how often they've purchased in the past and how much they've spent overall. The main objective is to segment customers based on the above three parameters and tailor marketing strategies for each segment.


## Source Data

The dataset is Superstore dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bravehart101/sample-supermarket-dataset). 

## Data Preprocessing

1.    Identify any missing or duplicate values (none for this project). 
2.    Convert order_date and ship_date columns to datetime type.

## Workflow

1.	Convert negative and zero values to 1 so that they wonâ€™t cause infinite numbers during the log transformation. 
2.	Perform log transformation to bring data into a normal or near-normal distribution. This step can improve the performance of the clustering algorithm.
3.	Standardize the transformed data using StandardScaler function to ensure that all features are on the same scale.
4.	Use Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters for the K-means algorithm.

5. Perform K-means clustering with the number of clusters set to 3, based on the optimal number of clusters determined in step 4.
6. Assign customer segments to one of three levels: "whales" for high-value customers, "lapsed" for low-value customers, and "promising" for medium-value customers.

## Results

![alt text](https://github.com/QiujiaGuo/RFM-Analysis-for-Customer-Segmentation/blob/main/percentage%20for%20each%20cluster.png)

The "whales" cluster includes customers who order frequently and bring in a large amount of revenue. This cluster represents 35.44% of the total customer base in the dataset.

The "promising" cluster includes customers who order occasionally but still generate a decent amount of monetary sales. It represents 40.86% of the total customer base in the dataset.

The "lapsed" cluster includes customers who have either made a purchase a long time ago or have made a purchase with a minimal amount. It represents 23.71% of the total customer base in the dataset.

## Business Recommendation

1.	Retain "Whales": offer exclusive discounts, loyalty programs, or personalized customer service to keep them engaged and loyal.
2.	Nurture "Promising" Customers: offer personalized product recommendations or discounts to encourage them to increase their purchase frequency and become loyal customers.
3.	Target "Lapsed" Customers: offer special promotions, incentives, or discounts to bring them back. 

## Limitations

Subjectivity in Choosing Optimal Number of Clusters: While the elbow method provides a way to estimate the optimal number of clusters, the choice of the number of clusters can be subjective. The optimal number of clusters may vary depending on the dataset, and there may not be a clear elbow point on the graph.

## Future Improvements

While the elbow method is a useful starting point for determining the optimal number of clusters in K-means clustering, there are other methods that can provide more robust and objective results, such as silhouette method. By considering a variety of methods and comparing the results, we can make more informed decisions about the optimal clustering solution for our data.
